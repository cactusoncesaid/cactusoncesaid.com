This aspect really encouraged us to work on our own and press through our creativity individually, to have a better understanding of ourselves and our creativity. The program was very challenging yet very powerful, as it helped me reach a level of design work I never thought I would. We had courses of all sorts, and within each course we were introduced to the print and digital version of each, in order to learn about everything we need to know. They truly pushed us to outside our comfort zone and outside our understanding of design and creativity that we have never thought we would achieve. In addition, this program helped us achieve our own individual identity of who we are and our design style in the design world. Now I am ready to face many challenges and projects in my life with all confidence and power.</span><div class="name"></div><span class="v776_598">Personal projects</span><span class="v776_599">Masters Projects</span><div class="v922_5257"><div class="v295_4005"></div><div class="v922_5256"></div></div><div class="v980_1071"></div></div></body></html>
